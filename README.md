# Player Name Print
simple quake mod that modifies the game to show the name of the player currently under the player's crosshair


The magic happens in client.qc in the function 'printPlayerUnderCrosshair' it does what it says with minimal side effects - feel free to incorporate as a snippet in your own custom quake mod!

A snippet with just the changes (and no other files or calling functions) can be found in my gist [here](https://gist.github.com/BenVanCitters/a157f58e906bf00adc39a484cbcee12f)
